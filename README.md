# orchestral-observatory
A C++ visualization tool for multi-agent AI orchestration. Render agents in a grid-based octagonal layout, highlighting hierarchical relationships, activity states, and message flows. Built with SDL2 and OpenGL for lightweight, real-time rendering. Designed as a modular scaffold so agent data can be plugged in later.
